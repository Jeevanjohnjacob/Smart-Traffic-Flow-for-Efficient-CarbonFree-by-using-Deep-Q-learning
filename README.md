# Smart-Traffic-Flow-for-Efficient-CarbonFree-by-using-Deep-Q-learning
This work proposes a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based adaptive traffic signal control system that reduces congestion, vehicle delay, and emissions. By learning optimal signal timings in real time, it outperforms traditional fixed-time methods, promoting smarter and more sustainable urban traffic management.
